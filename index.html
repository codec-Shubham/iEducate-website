            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The primary education in India is divided into two parts, namely
                Lower Primary (Class I-V) and Upper Primary (Middle school, Class VI-VIII). The Indian government
                lays emphasis on primary education (Class I-VIII) also referred to as elementary education, to
                children aged 6 to 14 years old. Because education laws are given by the states, duration of
                primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child
                labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both
                free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social
                conditions. 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported,
                making it the largest provider of education in the country.
                However, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive
                gaps
                including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training.
                Figures released by the Indian government in 2011 show that there were 5,816,673 elementary school
                teachers in India.
                As of March 2012 there were 2,127,000 secondary school teachers in India. Education has also been made
                free for children for  years
                of age or up to class VIII under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain
                aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering
                skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality,
                kindness, and honesty.
                Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking
                in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require
                that education
                results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of
                the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer,
                not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dis
                positions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission
                of cultural heritage from one generation to the next.
                Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new
                ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex
                vocational skills.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states
                and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans,
                programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are
                created
                to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies. State governments and local
                government
                bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed
                elementary
                schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In
                2005-6
                83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of
                schools
                were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the
                Education
                Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are
                'aided'
                and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed
                schools
                in the ratio
                73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower (36:66)/
